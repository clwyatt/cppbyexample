To Do List:

https://github.com/fitzgen/pycco.git

* fix spacing so that comments don't run together
* add parsing and rendering of shell output files

* make first comment and last comment blocks special so that they span both columns?

* integrate with .dexy for compilation and output generation
* create "dynamic" examples using git (commit message and comments)
