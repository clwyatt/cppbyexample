// A C++ program has an entry point
// where the code starts running called
// main.

// main is a function that returns an integer [1]
int main()
{
  // return a code to the invoking shell [2]
  return 0;
}

// Longer explaination based on that above, possibly
// with reference indicators like
// [1] longer discussion about forms of main, etc
// [2] longer discussion about shells and return code
