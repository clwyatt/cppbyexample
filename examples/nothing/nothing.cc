// This first example is a program that does nothing but demonstrates some basic
// ideas and shows how to compile this and future examples.

// The first defines a special function [1] named `main` that returns an integer.
// This is the _entry_ _point_, where our code begins executing.
int main()
{
  // Return a code to the invoking shell [2]
  return 0;
}

// Longer explaination based on that above, possibly
// with reference indicators like
//
// 1. We will see more about funtions later
// 2. The return code tells the program that runs our program (called a _shell_)
// if the program succeeded or not.
